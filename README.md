# Border Highlight Game
This is a simple game built using HTML canvas and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to highlight all four sides of a square, which earns the player a point and also fills the square with their color.

# Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. There are no additional dependencies or installations required.

# How to Play
- The game board consists of a 9x9 grid of cells, with lines between them.
- Players take turns clicking on lines to highlight them.
- If a player completes a square (i.e. they highlight all four sides), they earn a point and fill the square with their color.
- The game ends when all squares have been filled.
- The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
- Syntax Highlighting
- The code in this project has been formatted for easy reading using syntax highlighting. This means that certain keywords, variables, and other elements within the code will be automatically highlighted in different colors, making it easier to understand what each part does.
